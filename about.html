								<p>Born and raised in Elsies River, I always hung onto the stories that were made of the people that flooded the communities and whose voices were never heard. To this I believed there was always a deep calling to have these untold stories embodied in writing or some sort of art form.</p>
								<p>I became a creative in the latter part of my high school career, writing scripts with my art teacher and finally pursuing language as a performative art in my studies at the University of the Western Cape. I later ventured into script writing at a publishing house in Cape Town that explored the Turkish soap operas. With so many stories that need to be told, I believe that my writing could expand in more spaces than what I currently occupy. Currently, as a copywriter, I have become engulfed in the spheres of Fashion, Lifestyle, Finance and Events.
									Apart from my 9-5, music has always been a passion and I have been crafting my art in the spaces of being a Wedding and Corporate DJ while writing music of my own - which you can also explore on this site.</p>
